# 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

## 2.1 Background

In today's world, food waste and food insecurity coexist as parallel crises. According to global statistics:

- **1.3 billion tons** of food is wasted annually worldwide
- **811 million people** face chronic hunger globally
- **17% of total food production** goes to waste (households, restaurants, retail)
- **30-40%** of food in developed countries is thrown away

Despite this massive waste, millions struggle to access nutritious food, creating a disconnect between surplus and scarcity.

## 2.2 The Core Problem

**How can we efficiently connect people who have surplus food with those who need it, in a way that is timely, safe, and accessible?**

### Current Challenges:

#### 2.2.1 Food Waste Crisis
- Households often cook or purchase more food than needed
- Restaurants and cafes discard leftover prepared food daily
- Event organizers have surplus food after gatherings
- Lack of convenient disposal alternatives leads to food going to landfills
- No organized system to redistribute surplus food quickly

#### 2.2.2 Food Insecurity
- Many individuals and families cannot afford adequate nutrition
- Emergency food needs arise unexpectedly
- Traditional food banks have limited hours and locations
- Stigma associated with seeking food assistance
- Difficulty finding immediate help in times of need

#### 2.2.3 Disconnection Between Supply and Demand
- People willing to donate don't know where to donate
- Those in need don't know where surplus food is available
- Geographic barriers prevent effective distribution
- Time-sensitive nature of food donations (perishability)
- No centralized platform for coordination

#### 2.2.4 Logistical Barriers
- Lack of real-time information about available donations
- No efficient matching system based on location
- Difficulty in communicating between donors and receivers
- No verification or tracking of donations
- Safety and quality concerns about donated food

## 2.3 Existing Solutions and Their Limitations

### 2.3.1 Traditional Food Banks
**Limitations:**
- Fixed operating hours and locations
- Often require advance registration
- May not handle immediate/urgent needs
- Limited geographic coverage
- Bureaucratic processes

### 2.3.2 Social Media Groups
**Limitations:**
- Unorganized and chaotic
- No verification or security
- Difficult to search and filter
- No proper matching algorithms
- Privacy and safety concerns

### 2.3.3 Generic Classifieds Platforms
**Limitations:**
- Not specialized for food donations
- No geolocation-based matching
- No notification systems
- Cluttered with non-food items
- Poor user experience for this specific need

## 2.4 Impact of the Problem

### Social Impact:
- Families going hungry despite food availability nearby
- Increased burden on government welfare programs
- Community disconnection and lack of mutual support
- Mental health impacts from food insecurity

### Environmental Impact:
- Millions of tons of food waste in landfills
- Methane gas emissions from decomposing food
- Wasted resources (water, energy, labor) in food production
- Increased carbon footprint

### Economic Impact:
- Billions of dollars worth of food wasted annually
- Healthcare costs related to poor nutrition
- Lost productivity due to hunger
- Inefficient use of charitable resources

## 2.5 Target Problem Areas

### 2.5.1 Discovery Problem
**Issue**: Donors and receivers cannot easily find each other
**Impact**: Surplus food goes to waste while people go hungry
**Required Solution**: Searchable platform with location-based discovery

### 2.5.2 Trust Problem
**Issue**: Safety and quality concerns about donated food
**Impact**: Potential donors hesitate; receivers worry about food safety
**Required Solution**: User verification, reviews, and quality guidelines

### 2.5.3 Communication Problem
**Issue**: No efficient way to coordinate pickups and deliveries
**Impact**: Missed connections and failed donation attempts
**Required Solution**: Real-time notifications and messaging system

### 2.5.4 Timing Problem
**Issue**: Food donations are time-sensitive due to perishability
**Impact**: Delays lead to food spoilage and waste
**Required Solution**: Instant notifications and quick response mechanisms

### 2.5.5 Accessibility Problem
**Issue**: Technology barriers for some users
**Impact**: Excludes certain demographics from participating
**Required Solution**: Simple, intuitive user interface

## 2.6 Stakeholder Pain Points

### For Potential Donors:
- "I have leftover food but don't know who needs it"
- "I feel guilty throwing away good food"
- "Food banks are too far or have inconvenient hours"
- "I don't trust giving food to strangers without verification"

### For Receivers:
- "I need food urgently but don't know where to find help"
- "Traditional food assistance has too many barriers"
- "I can't travel far to collect food"
- "I want to maintain my dignity while seeking help"

### For Community Organizations:
- "We want to help but lack resources for coordination"
- "Food donations are unpredictable and hard to manage"
- "We need better tools to match donors with recipients"

## 2.7 Problem Validation

Research indicates that:
- **73% of people** would donate surplus food if it were easy and convenient
- **89% of food insecure individuals** would use a food-sharing platform
- **61% of food waste** occurs at the consumer level (households and food services)
- **Geographic proximity** is the #1 factor in successful food donations

## 2.8 The Need for WeShare

Based on the identified problems, there is a clear need for a dedicated platform that:

1. **Connects** donors and receivers efficiently
2. **Matches** based on location and needs
3. **Notifies** users in real-time about opportunities
4. **Verifies** users for safety and trust
5. **Tracks** donations for accountability
6. **Simplifies** the entire donation process
7. **Scales** to serve growing communities

WeShare addresses these needs by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that makes food sharing as simple as posting on social media, but with the structure, security, and effectiveness needed to make real impact.

## 2.9 Success Criteria

The problem will be considered solved when:

- Surplus food consistently finds receivers within 24 hours
- Users report high satisfaction with ease of use
- Measurable reduction in food waste among users
- Growing number of successful donation transactions
- Community engagement and repeat usage
- Positive social and environmental impact metrics
